## Project Description
Our project is an interactive, music-making environment. The environment allows you to interact with objects by tapping on them with tracked drumstick(s) and produce sounds depending on the object you've tapped on. There are different areas in the environment corresponding to different genres of music, with each object in said area being an instrument that will produce a corresponding sound when interacted with.
